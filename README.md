# Master Python Journey

Welcome to my **Master Python Journey** repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress in Python by building various projects. Each project is stored in its own folder, following a structured learning approach.

## 📌 Project 1: CLI-Based Calculator

### 📂 Folder Structure

```
Master-Python-Journey/
│-- 001_calculator_cli_based/
│   │-- calculator.py
│   │-- README.md
```

### 📜 Description

This is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) based calculator** built using Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as:

✅ Addition (+)
✅ Subtraction (-)
✅ Multiplication (\*)
✅ Division (/)
✅ Exponentiation (\*\*)
✅ Modulus (%)
✅ Floor Division (//)

### 🛠 Features

- User input validation to handle errors.
- Supports continuous calculations.
- Prevents division by zero errors.

### 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Tahaansaribinjaved/Master-Python-Journey.git
```

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
 cd Master-Python-Journey/001_calculator_cli_based
```

3️⃣ Run the calculator:

```bash
 python calculator.py
```

### 📷 Screenshot (Optional)

Add a screenshot of your CLI calculator in action.

### 📚 Future Improvements

- Add support for advanced mathematical functions.
- Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Convert it into a web-based calculator using Flask.
