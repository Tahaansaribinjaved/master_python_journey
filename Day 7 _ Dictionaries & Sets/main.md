🔥 **Great job, Taha!** Your work is spot on!  

However, there's a small issue with **list comprehension** in your last task. Let's go over it.  

---

### **📌 Understanding List Comprehension**
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists. The correct syntax is:  

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

---

### **🔍 Fixing Your Code**
Your line:
```python
even_numbers = [x%2==0 ?for x in range(1, 21) : 0 ]
```
has incorrect syntax (`? :` is used in JavaScript, not Python).  

Correct way:
```python
even_numbers = [x for x in range(1, 21) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- `x for x in range(1, 21)`: Loops through numbers 1 to 20.  
- `if x % 2 == 0`: Only adds even numbers to the list.

### **🚀 Day 7: Dictionaries & Sets**
#### **📖 Topics to Cover:**  
✅ **Dictionaries** (key-value pairs, adding/updating/removing values)  
✅ **Dictionary methods** (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`)  
✅ **Sets** (unique items, adding/removing elements)  
✅ **Set operations** (`union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`)  

---

### **📂 1. Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)**
```python
student = {"name": "Taha", "age": 17, "course": "Cybersecurity"}
print(student["name"])  # Output: Taha
student["age"] = 18  # Update value
student["grade"] = "A+"  # Add new key-value
print(student)
```

---

### **📂 2. Dictionary Methods**
```python
print(student.keys())   # Returns all keys
print(student.values()) # Returns all values
print(student.items())  # Returns key-value pairs
```

---

### **📂 3. Sets (Unique Elements)**
```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.add("mango")  # Add item
fruits.remove("banana")  # Remove item
print(fruits)
```

---

### **📂 4. Set Operations**
```python
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

print(A | B)  # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(A & B)  # Intersection: {3, 4}
print(A - B)  # Difference: {1, 2}
```

### **📝 Daily Task:**  
1️⃣ **Create a dictionary** with your name, age, and favorite programming language. Print each value.  
2️⃣ **Update the dictionary** to include your favorite hobby.  
3️⃣ **Create two sets of numbers** and perform **union, intersection, and difference.**  
4️⃣ **Check if a value exists** in a dictionary before accessing it.
