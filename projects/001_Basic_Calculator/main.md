### **📌 Steps to Build a Basic Calculator**  

1️⃣ **Ask the user for two numbers**  
   - Take input from the user (remember to convert it to a number).  

2️⃣ **Ask the user for an operation**  
   - Let the user choose from:  
     ➕ Addition  
     ➖ Subtraction  
     ✖️ Multiplication  
     ➗ Division  

3️⃣ **Perform the calculation**  
   - Use conditions (`if-else`) to check the chosen operation and apply the correct formula.  

4️⃣ **Display the result**  
   - Print the final answer nicely.  

5️⃣ **Handle errors**  
   - What if the user enters invalid input?  
   - What if they try to divide by zero?  
   - Add checks to handle these situations.
